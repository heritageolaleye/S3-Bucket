Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a fully managed object storage service that is offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

An S3 bucket is a storage container in S3 used to store objects, which can be files, images, videos, databases, etc. Each object in an S3 bucket is stored as a key-value pair, where the key is the unique identifier of the object and the value is the data itself.
